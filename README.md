# Marian's Blog

This blog is a CMS that I decided to work on as a way of practising Ruby and Rails but also as a tool for me to remember things that I've learned.

To create this app I used RoR, Haml, JS, Sass, plus gems like `simple_form`, `paperclip`, `devise`, `redcarpet`, `will_paginate`, among others. For the admin I used the materialize framework but for the blog itself, I created all the styles from scratch.

So far there are a few tests and an integration with my portfolio website (www.marianserna.com) that allows me to show the latest 3 posts in the portfolio.
